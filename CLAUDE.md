# HOA Board Management — Project Guide

Internal board management portal for an HOA. Also a portfolio project for Jake (president of the HOA, applying for software engineering roles). Public GitHub repo.

**Working directory:** `/Users/jake/dev/hoa-board-manager`
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/JakeBarron/hoa-board-manager`

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript — **read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any Next.js code** |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui v4 (backed by `@base-ui/react`) |
| Backend | Supabase — Postgres DB + Auth + Storage |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Package manager | pnpm |
| Testing | Jest + React Testing Library (221 tests, all passing) |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod |
| CSV parsing | PapaParse — browser-native, handles BOM; use for all client-side CSV work |

## Critical Next.js 16 Gotchas

- Middleware is now **`proxy.ts`** (not `middleware.ts`). Export `proxy` not `middleware`.
- `params` **and** `searchParams` in page components are both **Promises** — always `await` them:
  ```ts
  const { id } = await params;
  const { date } = await searchParams;
  ```
- Tailwind v4 uses **CSS `@theme`** in `globals.css` — no `tailwind.config.ts` for theme tokens.

## Critical shadcn/ui v4 Gotcha

shadcn/ui v4 uses `@base-ui/react`. **`asChild` does not exist.** To render a Button as a Link:
```tsx
// ✅ correct — nativeButton={false} required because Link renders <a>, not <button>
<Button nativeButton={false} render={<Link href="/path" />}>Label</Button>

// ❌ wrong — will not compile
<Button asChild><Link href="/path">Label</Link></Button>

// ❌ wrong — triggers Base UI warning (Button expects <button>, Link renders <a>)
<Button render={<Link href="/path" />}>Label</Button>
```

## Critical Supabase TypeScript Gotchas

**Every table type must have `Relationships: []`** or the Supabase client's `from()` generic collapses to `never` and `.insert()` / `.update()` break with misleading type errors:
```ts
// ✅ in types/database.ts — every table needs this
todos: {
  Row: { ... };
  Insert: { ... };
  Update: { ... };
  Relationships: [];   // ← required even if empty
};
```

**Never destructure `{ data }` inline from `Promise.all`** — TypeScript loses table-specific type inference:
```ts
// ✅ correct
const [r1, r2] = await Promise.all([query1, query2]);
const thing1 = r1.data;

// ❌ breaks inference — everything becomes `never`
const [{ data: thing1 }, { data: thing2 }] = await Promise.all([...]);
```

**Cast URL params when using in `.eq()` calls** — Next.js gives `string`, Supabase expects the column's enum type:
```ts
.eq("name", position as PositionName)
```

---

## Coding Standards (non-negotiable)

- **JSDoc on every exported function** — what it does, params, return value, non-obvious behavior
- **Functions do one thing** — split before adding complexity
- **Pure functions preferred** — same input → same output, no hidden state
- **Side effects isolated** — DB writes never mixed with transformation logic
- **`map`/`filter`/`reduce`** for data transforms — never mutate in place
- **No `any`** — use `unknown` + type guards at system boundaries
- **No `asChild`** — see shadcn gotcha above
- **No default exports** except Next.js page/layout files
- **Absolute imports** via `@/` — never `../../../`
- **Tests co-located** with source files (`foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`)
- **Test behavior, not implementation** — no snapshot tests
- **Simplicity gate**: if something isn't simple, stop and rethink before implementing

## Auth & Permissions

**Position-based accounts** — 13 fixed accounts (8 board + 5 committee chairs). No self-registration.

| Role | Who | What they can do |
|---|---|---|
| `president` | President | Full access + admin (manage positions, change settings, record votes) |
| `officer` | VP, Secretary | Read all + edit any section |
| `member` | Treasurer, Pool, Membership, Tennis, Social | Read all + edit own section only |
| `chair` | Web, Architecture, Welcoming, Clubhouse, CRA | Access `/dashboard` and `/committee/[their-name]` only |

**Chair routing:** Every restricted dashboard page has a per-page guard — `if (isChair(role)) redirect('/committee/${name}')`. The Sidebar also renders a minimal nav (Home + My Office) for chairs. ⚠️ Permission audit pending — some pages may be missing the chair redirect guard (known: `/cra/new` accessible to chairs via direct URL).

Permission checks live in `lib/permissions.ts`. RLS policies enforce the same rules at the DB layer.

**Treasury permission:** `canEditTreasury(role, positionName)` — president, officer roles, or the Treasurer position specifically. All authenticated users can read treasury data. Note: officers (VP + Secretary) having edit rights is an explicit policy decision, not a default.

**Route protection:** `proxy.ts` → `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` → `updateSession()` calls `getUser()` (verified server-side, not just cookie) and redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated. `/architecture/[id]` is intentionally public (homeowner deep-link sharing).

---

## Database

All tables in Supabase public schema with RLS enabled.

| Table(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `positions` | 13 rows (8 board + 5 chairs) — position name → email → role |
| `architecture_requests`, `architecture_documents` | Homeowner requests; public read via anon RLS |
| `cra_projects`, `cra_quotes`, `cra_updates`, `cra_documents` | Capital projects tracker |
| `meeting_minutes`, `todos`, `pre_meeting_updates` | Per-position board content |
| `meetings` | Scheduled meetings (pending → in_progress → adjourned) |
| `motions`, `motion_votes` | Formal motions + per-member votes; schema ready, no UI yet |
| `meeting_documents` | Drive links for approved minutes + amendments |
| `settings` | Configurable key/value pairs (quorum_required, hoa_name, meeting_cadence) |
| `fiscal_years` | One row per budget year — label, start/end dates, default assessment amount, draft/approved status |
| `budget_line_items`, `budget_monthly_amounts` | Annual budget by GL code + monthly breakdown; populated via Homeside CSV import |
| `budget_category_actuals` | Treasurer's monthly YTD actuals at category level; upsert on (fiscal_year, category, account_type, date) |
| `cash_balances` | Point-in-time Operating + Reserve account balances entered by treasurer |
| `assessment_payments` | Per-property dues payment status per fiscal year; seeded from properties table on year creation |

**Supabase clients:**
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — Server Components and Server Actions
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — Client Components
- Both typed with `Database` from `types/database.ts`

**meeting_cadence format:** stored as `"week:dayOfWeek"` (e.g. `"3:2"` = 3rd Tuesday).
Parse with `parseCadence()` and generate dates with `getUpcomingMeetingDates()` from `lib/dates.ts`.

**Seed:** `pnpm seed` — idempotent, safe to re-run.

## What's Built vs. What's Stubbed

### Fully functional
- Login / logout (Supabase Auth) + route protection
- `/dashboard` (Home) — board-wide summary: pending arch requests + active CRA projects
- `/meetings` — list with status badges; officer+ can schedule via `/meetings/new`
- `/architecture` — full requests list with StatusBadge; president sees inline VoteForm on pending items
- `/architecture/[id]` — public detail page (outside dashboard group, no auth)
- `/board/[position]` — My Office for board members: todos preview + pre-meeting form + minutes card
- `/board/[position]/todos` — full CRUD, permission-gated
- `/board/[position]/minutes` — list with Drive links + per-row docx export
- `/board/[position]/minutes/new` — Tiptap WYSIWYG → docx → Drive URL flow
- `/committee/[chair]` — My Office for committee chairs: pre-meeting form; architecture chair also sees requests list
- `/pre-meeting` — officer/president aggregate view of all updates by date; members + chairs redirected to own page
- `/agenda` — HOA meeting agenda (call to order → approve minutes → board reports → committee reports → new business → adjourn); officer+ get mailto: reminder for missing submissions
- `/meetings/[id]` — meeting runner (non-realtime, secretary-controlled): motions, voting, live minutes via Tiptap, `.docx` export, Drive URL storage; amendment form for post-adjournment corrections
- `/meetings` — list with status badges; officer+ schedule via inline modal (`MeetingScheduleForm`) and can cancel/reschedule existing meetings
- `/architecture/new` — board members create requests + upload the homeowner's PDF to Supabase Storage (multi-file, `FileUploadButton`)
- `/admin/positions` — lists positions + emails with inline edit (`PositionEditRow`); changing an email updates the Supabase auth user and sends a password reset
- `/admin/settings` — configurable settings with inline save; meeting cadence uses dropdown UI
- `/map` — interactive neighborhood lot map (`MapView` + `NeighborhoodMap`); click a polygon to see property details; voting members only, chairs redirected
- `/treasury`, `/treasury/actuals`, `/treasury/budget` — financial dashboard (cash on hand, budget vs actuals, assessment collection), YTD actuals + cash balance entry, and Homeside GL CSV import; all authenticated users read, `canEditTreasury` writes
- `/documents` — document library with signed-URL downloads
- Password reset — `/confirm-reset` + `/update-password` pages backed by `actions/auth.ts`

### Stubbed (page exists, placeholder only)
- `/amenities` — Pool, Clubhouse, Tennis (`EmptyState`; no spec written yet)
- `/cra` — `EmptyState` (see `docs/specs/cra-projects.md`)
- `/cra/new` — "Coming soon" placeholder; no `/cra/[id]` page yet. Schema (`cra_projects`, `cra_quotes`, `cra_updates`, `cra_documents`) is ready and the dashboard reads active projects, but there is no create/edit/quote/update UI.

### Not started
- Operating Calendar — treasurer's request: key annual dates + deliverables with templates. No route, component, or schema yet.
- Pre-Meeting / Agenda merge — fold the pre-meeting updates page into the agenda (low priority; spec file not yet written)

### Schema-ready, no UI
- Motions/voting UI — `motions` and `motion_votes` tables exist; the meeting runner uses them but there is no dedicated motion-proposal or per-member voting UI (secretary records everything)

---

## Key Patterns

### Server action shape
```ts
"use server";
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";

export async function myAction(arg: string): Promise<void> {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  // RLS enforces auth — still check role for clear error messages
  const { error } = await supabase.from("table").insert({ ... });
  if (error) throw new Error(error.message);
  revalidatePath("/relevant-path", "layout");
}
```

### Page data fetching
```ts
// Run independent queries in parallel; assign data separately
const [r1, r2] = await Promise.all([
  supabase.from("positions").select("id, name, role").eq("email", user.email!).single(),
  supabase.from("todos").select("*").eq("position_id", id),
]);
const position = r1.data;
const todos = r2.data;
```

### Meeting dates
Pages that show date pickers should:
1. Check `meetings` table for upcoming scheduled meetings
2. Fall back to `getUpcomingMeetingDates(cadence, 3)` using `meeting_cadence` from `settings`
3. Fall back to `getUpcomingMondays(3)` if cadence is invalid

---

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # start dev server (run from /Users/jake/dev/hoa-board-manager)
pnpm build        # production build
pnpm test         # run Jest (221 tests)
pnpm type-check   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm seed         # seed 13 position accounts against .env.local (e2e project)
pnpm lint         # ESLint
```

To seed the **production** Supabase project:
```bash
npx tsx --env-file=.env.prod supabase/seed.ts
```

---

## Environment Variables

Three env files (none committed):

| File | Points to | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.local` | E2E Supabase project | Local dev + pnpm seed |
| `.env.prod` | Prod Supabase project | One-off prod scripts (e.g. seed) |

```bash
# both files have the same keys:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...   # legacy format (not sb_publishable_)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...       # legacy format, server-side only
```

Use **legacy JWT keys** from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → "Legacy anon, service_role API keys" tab. The new `sb_publishable_` / `sb_secret_` format is not yet fully supported by `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.

**Vercel environment scoping:**
- `Production` env vars → prod Supabase project (live at `board.eastspringlake.com`)
- `Preview` + `Development` env vars → e2e Supabase project (has seed data)

Every branch PR auto-deploys against the e2e database. `main` deploys against prod.

---

## CI/CD & Branch Workflow

**main is locked** — never push directly. All changes go through a branch + PR.

Merge requirements:
- CI must pass (`pnpm type-check && pnpm test --ci`)
- 1 PR review required (CODEOWNERS: `@JakeBarron`)

Vercel deploys:
- `main` → production at `https://board.eastspringlake.com` (prod Supabase)
- Any branch PR → preview URL (e2e Supabase)

Supabase auth URL configuration (prod project → Authentication → URL Configuration):
- Site URL: `https://board.eastspringlake.com`
- Redirect URLs: `https://board.eastspringlake.com/*`
